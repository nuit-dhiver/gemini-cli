# Provider-Agnostic TUI Agent Runner Plan

## Big Picture
Develop a TUI application that allows users to run multiple AI agents (like Claude, Gemini, Ollama) concurrently. Each agent will have its own configuration, tools, and settings, enabling users to utilize various service provider APIs or local model instances.

## Structure
1. **Core Package**:
   - Act as the backend, managing API interactions, session state, and tool execution.
   - Include individual modules for each provider.
   - Manage credentials and configurations.

2. **CLI Package**:
   - Handle user interaction, input processing, display rendering, and session management.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for managing multiple agents.

3. **Tools**:
   - Extend capabilities with additional tools for file system interactions, shell command execution, etc.

## Surgical Changes
1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Modify handling to support multiple provider-specific configurations.
   - Store credentials, API keys, and specific tool settings.

2. **Agent Management**:
   - Add functionalities to spin up agents dynamically based on user input.
   - Implement API communication logic for different providers.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Update UI components to handle multiple concurrent session displays.
   - Implement UI elements for agent-specific settings and status.

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - Ensure core functionalities can support diverse agent types.
   - Integrate APIs and local instances in a seamless way.

## Tasks
1. **Create Configuration Structure**:
   - Define flexible configuration structure supporting multiple providers.
   
2. **Implement API Handling**:
   - Develop functions to handle API requests for different providers.
   - Include authentication procedures.

3. **Design UI Components**:
   - Build and enhance UI elements for multi-agent management.
   - Support for agent switching and monitoring.

4. **Develop Core Modules**:
   - Modify existing core functionality to handle multiple agents.
   - Integrate TUI with backend processes smoothly.

5. **Extend Toolset**:
   - Ensure tools can be selectively enabled for different agents.
   - Provide support for new tools as needed.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Implement comprehensive testing for multi-agent functionality.
   - Validate user experience and performance.
  
7. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect new functionalities.
   - Provide user guides for setting up and managing multiple agents.
